    <p>Hi! My name is nate. I go to school at UMAINE. I play drums and gutiar. in my free time, you will see me
        play frisbee , hang out with friends, or be watching either the boston sports teams or anything marvel.
    I graduated from Stearns high school. Stearns wasn't very good at sports, so I has heavily involved in the preforming arts.
    I was in Show choir, One Act, Jazz Band, Fall Musical, Pep band, and played drums in the pit band for the middle school show choir.
    During the summers, I am a Councilor at Camp Roosevelt. I have been working there for 5 years, as a C.I.T., Sports field Staff, and as a lifeguard at the waterfront.
    When I am not busy, I am an extreme Funko collector. I have collected about 200 pieces in a little under a year.  </p>
