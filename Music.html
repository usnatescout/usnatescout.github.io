<p>When I was younger, all I ever wanted to do was play the drums. I would love getting the chore of doing the dishes,
    because I could bang on pots and pans until I got yelled at. When I was in the 5th grade, I was told I couldn't play
    the drums until middle school and was told to take up a different instrument until then. It took the band teacher
    about 3 months for her to realize that I wasn't going to stop pestering her to play the drums. She made an exception
for me, and now thats what I do. Today, I play the drums, guitar, and sing. </p>
